# Contributing

This being a specific fork of the original container, feel free to report issues
and submit pull requests. I am not a devops nor a docker expert, so there might
be huge config errors. Please do report these issues if you see them.

If I merge your pull request I will add you to the contributors list.

Please do check
[the original repo too](https://github.com/kristophjunge/docker-test-saml-idp),
as this repo is not meant to be merged with it.
